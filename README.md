# The Place For Me
[Visit Site](https://theplacefor.me)

This progressive web app is intended to allow users to rank countries based on a wide variety of accurate and 100% customizable criteria. The main use-case I forsee is for people looking to move to different countries, set up a business in a different country, or just visit. When I have finished adding all of the datasets I plan to add I don't think there will be any tool comparable to this. 

This Repo is entirely a front-end single-page React app (built with create-react-app). It connects to [ThePlaceFor.Me public API](https://github.com/Sheldonfrith/theplaceforme-backend) which handles all of the data processing and storage. If you think you can build a better UI for this same purpose feel free to use the public API to do just that... that is why I made it public.

For more information on the backend behind this app, consult [this wiki](https://github.com/Sheldonfrith/theplaceforme-backend/wiki) which contains the documentation necessary for those wishing to use the public API and also contains a description of the methodology I have used to calculate country rankings, decide what is and isn't a country, and decide what datasets to include.

I'm looking for work, visit [my personal website](https://sheldonfrith.com) to view my portfolio, resume and contact info.
